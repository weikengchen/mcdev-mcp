For container screens (chests, anvils, brewing stands, etc.) also returns
{menuClass, slots: [{idx, container, item:{itemId, count, damage, maxDamage,
name}}]} in a single native pass — avoids the per-call Java<->Lua bridge
cost that times out when iterating slots from Lua.

Set includeIcons=true to also receive a top-level icons map keyed by itemId
({base64Png, width, height, spriteName}) — lets you see every item in the
container in one call. Deduplicated across slots so a chest of stone+dirt
only renders two icons. Adds a few KB to the response per unique item.`,
